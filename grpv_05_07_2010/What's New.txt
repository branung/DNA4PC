GRPViewer build 03.28.2010 release notes:

+fixed Go2Tile input box position on window resizing

GRPViewer build 03.05.2010 release notes:

- animated clock showing GRPV busy state is now removed ffs
- boring left-right-up-down buttons for scrolling map are now removed
+ scrolling and zooming is bound to mouse wheel in combination with shift and ctrl buttons (slow as hell, wonder if I could render the stuff through DirectDraw one day)
+ Go2Tile feature is available, just put the desired Tile Number in teh input field and hit enter
+ Highlight Wall by Tile Number feature to help finding places in the map where you want too look at the newly created tile in game, put the desired wall tile into the input field and scroll the map to find thick blue walls
+ backspace is now active for returning from maps and art entries into the grp content list
+ copy to clipboard is available from the context menu of selected entry, it was designed for art tile only but works for map view mode aswell, basically it grabs anything that's rendered in the Art Preview window, dont mess with zoom buttons before copying to clipboard otherwise you'll get upscaled image which may be undesired


------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1c [b: 01/03/05] Test Release
1. md3 loader which shows basic md3 info in log window. The md3 renderer is still
under construction.

Version 1.1c [b: 12/31/05] Test Release
1. Rewrote DEF parsing routine - now it's capable to handle any types of HRP and
as much includes in already included files as possible. HRTT works now with the latest HRP.

Version 1.1c [b: 11/06/05] Test Release
1. Added support for ART files. You can now open ART files from disc, browse it

2. Added support for external ART files. Doubleclicking on embedded ART file while
browsing any GRP file forces GRPV to check if there is an external ART file with
the same name.
3. Few minor fixes.

Version 1.1c [b: 06/13/05] Test Release
1. Palette is loaded now from the opened GRP file, if you still have
"palette.dat" file in GRPViewer's dir it's recommended to delete it, otherwise
it will be always loaded - thus ignoring the original palette embedded into GRP
file.
2. "names.h" for both Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior are stored in GRPV's
executable. It's recommended to delete "names.h" file from GRPViewer's dir to
allow GRPV to detect both games automatically and to load the apropriate "names"
for the loaded GRP file.
